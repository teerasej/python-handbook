# Custom Iterator

Imagine you are developing an application that needs to process and display a large dataset, such as customer records or transaction logs. Loading the entire dataset into memory at once is inefficient and can cause performance issues, especially when dealing with millions of records. In such cases, you can use iterators to process the dataset one item at a time, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

## Benefits

1. Memory Efficiency: Only a small subset of the data is loaded into memory at any given time.
2.	Scalability: The application can handle large datasets efficiently by processing data in chunks.
3.	User Experience: Provides a smoother and faster user experience by displaying data in pages, reducing load times.

## Example 

1. [Iterator](./start.md)
2. [Simple Custom Iterator](./custom_iterator.md)
3. [Custom Iterator for Paginated Records](./paginated_iterator.md)
