# Decorators

In a real-world scenario, decorators can be extremely useful for logging function calls, tracking performance, and managing access control. For example, in a web application, a logging decorator can be used to log the entry and exit points of various functions, including the arguments passed and the time taken to execute them. This can be invaluable for debugging and performance monitoring.


## Example
1. [Function Decorator](./start.md)
2. [Multiple Decorators](./multi_decorator.md)
3. [Class Decorator](./class_decorator.md)
