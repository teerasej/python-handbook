# Context Manager

Context managers are especially useful for managing resources like file operations, ensuring that files are properly opened and closed without requiring explicit close statements, which reduces the risk of resource leaks. For example, when working with large files in a data processing pipeline, context managers ensure that files are safely closed after processing, even if an error occurs during the operation.
