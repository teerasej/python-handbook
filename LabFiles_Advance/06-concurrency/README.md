# Concurrency & Parallelism

Web scraping involves extracting data from multiple web pages. Concurrency and parallelism can significantly speed up this task by fetching and processing multiple pages simultaneously, rather than sequentially. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of pages or when the web serverâ€™s response time is slow.
